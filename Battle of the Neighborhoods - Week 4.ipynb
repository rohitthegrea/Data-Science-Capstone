In the US, about 35% of the population (which is approximately 82 million) are obese. Obesity often adds to various diseases and conditions - often for life. Obesity is one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide. It is linked to various cardiovascular diseases, Type 2 Diabetes, few types of cancer, high blood pressure, apnea etc. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that overweight and obesity may soon replace more traditional public health concerns such as undernutrition and infectious diseases as the most significant cause of poor health. Obesity also has taken a toll on healty care costs across the country\u2014estimated between 187 billion dollars and 265 billion dollars in direct and indirect health care costs, as of 2019.\n\nThe main treatment for obesity consists of weight loss via calorie restricted dieting. However, dieting over a long period of time is quite hard. Thus physical exercise is equally important. As someone who used to be overweight, I have decided to focus on reducing this issue by facilitating construction of gyms and/or yoga classes. "

Obesity is a major problem in Chicago, where 36.2% of the city's high school students and 61.2% of adults in the metropolitan area are overweight or obese. That is among the highest in the entire country! The aim of this project is to successfully locate suitable locations to construct Gym and/or yoga classes in Chicago. They should be in a place having no access to gym/yoga classes but having a considerable population."

I will then run k-means algorithm.\n\n6) I will then plot all the clusters on a map using folium library.\n\n7) Final analysis of each clusters and from that I will determine the best place to open a new gym/yoga class (hopefully!)."
